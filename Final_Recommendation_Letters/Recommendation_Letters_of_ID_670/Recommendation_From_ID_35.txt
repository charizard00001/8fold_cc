I am pleased to recommend an exceptional professional whose skills in IT support and customer service make them a valuable asset in any technical environment. As a former Personnel Security Specialist, I had the privilege of working alongside this individual during their tenure as a Geek Squad Agent, where they showcased a strong commitment to problem-solving and customer satisfaction. Their experience in providing technical support across various platforms, coupled with their ability to communicate effectively with diverse clients, sets them apart.

With a background in both IT and military service, they have developed a unique skill set that includes technical troubleshooting, hardware maintenance, and user training, all of which contributed to the seamless operation of our security program. Their hard work, adaptability, and willingness to learn were evident throughout our time together. I have no doubt they will excel in any future endeavors, continuing to foster collaboration and innovation in their teams.
