Having worked alongside a remarkable director of theater, I wholeheartedly recommend the dedication and talent exhibited throughout the various facets of theater arts. My experience as an Arts Education Intern has allowed me to observe the impact of effective leadership in educational theater programs. The director has successfully rebuilt an award-winning theater program at an independent school, fostering creativity in students through classes in acting, playwrighting, and physical theater. They are not only committed to nurturing talent but also create meaningful experiences by inviting visiting artists, thereby enhancing the curriculum with practical insights.

In addition to directing multiple productions yearly, their collaboration with faculty to integrate theater into other disciplines demonstrates a strong understanding of the broader educational landscape. This individual’s expertise in both theater and education is inspiring, making significant contributions to the performing arts and positively shaping the future of aspiring artists and students alike.
