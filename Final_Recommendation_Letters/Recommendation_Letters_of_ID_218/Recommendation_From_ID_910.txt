As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I have had the privilege of observing the remarkable impact made by my colleague, a talented Director of Theater. This individual has successfully rebuilt an award-winning theater program at an independent school, transforming a previously faltering program into a vibrant hub of creative expression. With a rich background in theater education, they have developed and taught diverse courses in acting, playwrighting, and improvisation, fostering the next generation of artists. 

Their collaborative spirit shines through in arrangements with visiting artists and interdisciplinary events, creating a unique cultural nexus for students. The dedication to excellence is evidenced by numerous accolades, including recognition for outstanding productions at prestigious festivals. This commitment to the arts parallels my own efforts in enhancing the performing arts at our venues. With exceptional leadership, creativity, and a clear vision for artistic expression, I highly recommend this individual for any future endeavors in the performing arts.
