Having worked as an Executive Director managing a non-profit arts organization in a remote community, I have had the privilege of collaborating with an exceptional individual who has made significant contributions to the performing arts as a Director of Theater. This esteemed colleague has transformed a struggling theater program into an award-winning one at an independent school, demonstrating an admirable ability to cultivate talent while fostering a love for the arts among students.

Through innovative course development in acting, playwrighting, and physical theater, not only have they enhanced student engagement, but they have also effectively integrated theater with other disciplines. Their dedication to collaboration is evident in successfully arranging for visiting artists and engaging students in leadership and ethics discussions. This commitment to excellence is further reflected in numerous accolades received for outstanding productions. Their skills in educational leadership, combined with a strong background in theater, make them a vital asset to any organization committed to the arts.
