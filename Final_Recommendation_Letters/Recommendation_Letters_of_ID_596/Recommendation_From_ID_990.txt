Having worked together in overlapping sectors, I can confidently recommend the student who has recently completed a Bachelor’s degree in Interdisciplinary Social Science. This individual has shown exceptional dedication during their academic journey while simultaneously managing responsibilities at home, balancing a rigorous workload with personal commitments. Their experience serving in the U.S. Army provided a strong foundation in professionalism, integrity, and organizational skills, with significant exposure to personnel management and administrative duties.

While my role as an Aviation Fuel Quality Control Specialist honed my technical expertise and quality control processes, I deeply value the interpersonal and conflict resolution skills this individual has developed. They've effectively communicated with diverse groups and coordinated complex logistics in high-pressure environments, demonstrating their capability to thrive in demanding circumstances. The combination of practical experience and a solid educational background uniquely positions this student to excel in any social science-related career.
