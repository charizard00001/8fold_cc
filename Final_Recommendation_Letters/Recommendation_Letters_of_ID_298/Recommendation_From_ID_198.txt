I wholeheartedly recommend the Operations and Finance Manager for any finance-related role. With over eleven years of experience in managing collections, budget analysis, and financial reporting, they exhibit a strong command of essential financial principles. Leading teams effectively, they have successfully supervised branches within the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, driving improvements in customer relations and using their exceptional analytical skills in budgeting and financial compliance.

Their experience complements my role as a Finance Business Partner, where I focused on financial planning and analysis, leading the implementation of advanced financial planning tools and providing strategic insights that enhanced business growth. The operations manager’s extensive skill set in database management, financial analysis, and budgeting parallels well with my expertise in financial forecasting and insight generation. Together, these abilities foster a strong foundation for driving organizational success through sound financial strategies and operational efficiency. I have no doubt they will excel in any collaborative finance environment.
