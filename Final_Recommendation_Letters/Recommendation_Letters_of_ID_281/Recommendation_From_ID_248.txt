Having had the opportunity to work alongside an exceptional Information Technology Manager/Analyst, I can confidently recommend their capabilities. My experience as an Information Technology Specialist involved providing customer and technical support, often under pressure, which offered me insights into the critical importance of effective management in technology environments. During my time with Cigna Health Care, I witnessed how pivotal effective leadership and strategic vision are to ensuring seamless operations and customer satisfaction. 

In contrast, the IT Manager/Analyst has not only excelled in overseeing multifaceted projects but has also demonstrated remarkable skill in team development and strategic planning. Their innovative approach, as exemplified by successfully leading the implementation of the Software Development Lifecycle Methodology and launching a company-wide intranet, signifies their commitment to improving organizational functionality. Their ability to bridge both technology and team dynamics makes them a tremendous asset in any setting.
