As an experienced yoga instructor dedicated to wellness, I have had the privilege of working alongside Marissa, a program manager with a rich background in health promotion and tobacco cessation initiatives. Marissa's expertise in managing complex health programs, especially her role overseeing a $600,000 grant for tobacco cessation within community mental health, showcases her strategic leadership and commitment to improving community health outcomes. 

Having led wellness programs myself, I appreciate her ability to collaborate with diverse stakeholders, train wellness coaches, and develop measurable outcomes for health intervention strategies. With a shared passion for promoting healthy lifestyles, Marissa’s background as a fitness coach complements her program management skills, facilitating impactful community workshops and health seminars. Her knowledge and experience in health education have made a significant difference in the lives of those she serves. I confidently recommend her for any role that requires both expertise and a heartfelt commitment to health and well-being.
