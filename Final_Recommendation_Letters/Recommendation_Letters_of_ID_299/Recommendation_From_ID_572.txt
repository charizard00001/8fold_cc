In her ten years of comprehensive experience with the Government of the Republic of Zambia, she has exemplified diligence and commitment to financial management by preparing financial statements, monitoring expenditures, and ensuring compliance with government policies.

Her proficiency in reconciling accounts and auditing transactions highlights her attention to detail and reliability. Additionally, her strong organizational and communication skills have enabled her to provide guidance and training to colleagues effectively. The exemplary performance in her previous roles, including being recognized as the "Best Cashier" and "Best Back Office Clerk" at Barclays Bank, showcases her capability to thrive in demanding environments. The Assistant Accountant's proactive approach and exceptional integrity make her an outstanding asset to any financial team.
