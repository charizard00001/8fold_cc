In her role, she successfully supports teachers by preparing instructional materials, supervising students, and providing tailored assistance for those facing learning challenges. Her ability to communicate effectively with students, teachers, and parents speaks volumes about her interpersonal skills.

With a background that spans various roles, including special education assistance and substitute teaching, she possesses a rich skill set that enhances the learning experience for students. Her organizational abilities and understanding of diverse learning needs make her an invaluable asset to any educational institution. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any position that aims to foster a supportive and enriching learning environment.
