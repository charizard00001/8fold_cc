As a Financial Accountant with extensive experience in regulatory reporting, I am pleased to recommend a Payroll Accountant who has consistently demonstrated exceptional skill and professionalism in her role. With a solid seven years of experience, she has adeptly processed payroll for over 500 employees, showcasing her capability in multitasking and managing complex financial tasks under pressure. Her proficiency with payroll systems, particularly ADP, and her keen attention to detail have greatly enhanced our organization’s payroll accuracy and efficiency.

Throughout her tenure, she has collaborated closely with senior management, providing critical insights during month-end closes and audits, similar to the rigorous financial analyses I routinely conduct. Her ability to train and mentor others speaks to her leadership qualities and commitment to fostering a supportive team environment. I have no doubt she will be an invaluable asset to any organization she joins, bringing with her a wealth of knowledge and a strong work ethic.
