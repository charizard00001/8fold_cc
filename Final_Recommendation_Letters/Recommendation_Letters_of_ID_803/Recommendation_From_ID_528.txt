As an owner/operator of a successful functional training facility and former general manager of a leading fitness company, I have had the pleasure of witnessing exceptional talents in the industry. I strongly recommend the individual currently working as a cashier, who has displayed immense commitment and potential to excel in personal training. Their achievements as a Fitness Sales Ambassador, where they significantly increased client retention and contributed to a 40% sales boost in personal training, showcase their dedication and skill in this field.

While they excelled in customer service in their cashier role, it is their experience as a gym coordinator and personal trainer that highlights their passion for helping others achieve their fitness goals. With relevant qualifications, including a Personal Training Certification and a background in nutrition science, they possess the necessary knowledge and enthusiasm to thrive in a personal training setting. I am confident they will make a valuable addition to any fitness team.
