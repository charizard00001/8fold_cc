I am pleased to recommend the dedicated Desktop Support Engineer, who has excelled in providing comprehensive IT support and management for over nine years. Previously serving as an Aviation Ordinance Supervisor, he demonstrated exceptional leadership skills while supervising more than 130 personnel in the Navy. His ability to manage complex logistics and ensure compliance with stringent regulations speaks to his strong organizational abilities.

During his current role, he efficiently administers System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2, oversees the deployment of operating systems, and manages critical software patching. His experience directly complements my own as a former Gunnery Sergeant with extensive knowledge in network communication, system management, and personnel supervision. The proficiency in both hardware and software support allows him to resolve issues effectively for a sizable global user base. His commitment to high-quality service aligns perfectly with any team, making him an invaluable asset to any organization.
