Having worked as a research assistant in the College of Business Administration and Economics, I had the opportunity to observe the remarkable capabilities and initiative demonstrated in project management. The founder and project manager behind an online platform for Vietnam’s SMEs successfully directed various activities, effectively coordinating with international teams to meet project targets. This person’s solid understanding of risk assessment and opportunity analysis, developed through in-depth research, complemented their remarkable client service achievements during their tenure in the financial services industry. 

Bringing a client-centric approach, they excelled in managing high-volume portfolios while ensuring compliance with all regulations. Their ability to foster relationships and achieve consistent client satisfaction speaks volumes about their dedication and skillset. I have no doubt that their combination of financial acumen and entrepreneurial spirit will make a significant impact in any organization, making them an invaluable asset for future endeavors.
