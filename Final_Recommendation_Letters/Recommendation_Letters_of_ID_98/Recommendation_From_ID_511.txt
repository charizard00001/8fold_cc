Having worked as a VP of Finance & IS&T, I believe the Finance Manager’s contributions to the team have been invaluable. During their tenure, they have expertly managed all finances through Quick Books, demonstrating their financial acumen in budget planning and account reconciliation. Their ability to coordinate effectively with various stakeholders, especially during property transactions, showcases remarkable project management skills and exceptional communication abilities, which are key traits for any finance professional. 

The Finance Manager's impressive background, which includes supervising investment property rehabilitation and managing national real estate sales operations, aligns well with my vision for integrating financial strategies with operational effectiveness. Their proactive approach in resolving issues and negotiating contracts proves their resolve in contributing to the organization’s profitability. I strongly recommend this candidate, as their vast experience and dedication will undoubtedly translate into future success, benefitting any organization they join.
