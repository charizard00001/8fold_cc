As a seasoned Lead Operations Engineer on the Global Hawk Project at NASA, I had the privilege of witnessing an exceptional work ethic and team-oriented mindset in a dedicated Aviation Supply Specialist. Throughout her tenure in aviation supply, she consistently demonstrated meticulous quality control and problem-solving abilities, making her a reliable asset to both her coworkers and management. Her ability to manage inventory with precision and adhere to strict regulations significantly contributed to our operational success. 

She adeptly coordinated with cross-functional teams, ensuring that all supply chain processes were optimized to meet demanding timelines. Her capacity for clear communication and collaboration dovetailed perfectly with my role in overseeing high-altitude, long-endurance UAS operations, where attention to detail is paramount. Her dedication and commitment to excellence were evident in her work, and I highly recommend her for any role that requires a diligent and organized professional.
