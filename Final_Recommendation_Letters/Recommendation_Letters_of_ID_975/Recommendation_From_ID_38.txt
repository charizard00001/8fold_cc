In my role as an Aviation Electronics Technician, I have had the privilege of working alongside an exceptional Inside Account Manager whose dedication to customer service and organizational prowess has consistently impressed me. Over the years at SHI, this individual has honed their skills in account management, demonstrating an innate ability to build empathetic relationships with clients while managing complex orders and contracts, including a multi-year deal valued at $8 million with Novell. 

Their experience in training new hires reflects their leadership qualities and commitment to team success, which I greatly admire. As someone who has collaborated closely with various technical teams, I can attest to the importance of having professionals like this individual who not only excel in their specific roles but also understand how to navigate challenges and foster positive relationships within an organization. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any leadership position, knowing they will bring their strong analytical skills and customer-centric approach to the team.
