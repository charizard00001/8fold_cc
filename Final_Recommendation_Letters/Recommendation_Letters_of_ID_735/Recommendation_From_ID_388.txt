With over 17 years in the information technology field, the Information Technology Instructor has demonstrated substantial expertise in curriculum design and student training. Managing both student learning needs and two part-time instructors, this individual excels in creating market-driven IT programs while ensuring high standards of education and performance evaluation.

As the Director of Information Technology, the second person brings a wealth of experience, including overseeing technology delivery across hospitals and health clinics. Their role in implementing complex systems such as the Cerner Electronic Health Record showcases advanced project management skills and a commitment to enhancing operational efficiency. 

Having collaborated on various projects, including curriculum development for training programs, the instructor's insights and teaching proficiency would greatly benefit the director's training initiatives. Their shared focus on education, mentoring, and technology makes them a powerful duo in promoting knowledge and expertise within the IT landscape. I wholeheartedly support their ongoing collaboration and leadership in this field.
