Having served as a Combat Marksmanship Trainer and Primary Marksmanship Instructor, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with many skilled professionals, but Y. John Divakar stands out as an exceptional individual. In his role as Finance Manager at Moevenpick Hotel Sukhumvit 15 Bangkok, John has demonstrated remarkable leadership and analytical abilities. His expertise in financial management, combined with an extensive background in creating budgets and managing cash flow, showcases his capacity for detail-oriented work within a dynamic environment.

Throughout my career training Marines, I understand the importance of discipline and meticulousness, which I see reflected in John’s professional experiences. He has effectively handled financial operations and liaised with various departments, similar to coordinating training efforts in a military setting. His strong communication skills and ability to perform well under pressure make him an invaluable asset to any organization. I wholeheartedly recommend John for any opportunity that aligns with his competencies.
