The dedication to fitness and wellness displayed by the intern reflects a passion for helping others achieve their health goals, much like the commitment demonstrated throughout their mentor’s extensive career as a group fitness instructor. Over the years, their mentor has successfully launched and taught various innovative fitness programs, including the renowned Body Pump and Body Attack, while also integrating yoga into their offerings. The intern effectively applied their skills by shadowing training sessions, creating workout programs, and executing fitness challenges, showing promise as a fitness leader.

Working closely in the fitness community has allowed the intern to develop strong customer service and communication skills, further enhancing their ability to engage and motivate clients. With a solid educational foundation in Exercise Science, along with practical experience in corporate wellness and group settings, the intern stands poised to excel in a professional fitness career. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for opportunities that will further their impact on fitness and well-being.
