I highly recommend the Arts Education Intern for the exceptional dedication and skill demonstrated throughout their tenure in various roles related to arts education and performance. Currently excelling as an intern, they have effectively taught opera workshops, crafted study guides for local schools, and coordinated student matinees, showcasing an impressive ability to inspire and educate young minds in the arts.

As a Finance Manager, my experience has taught me the importance of meticulous organization and clear communication, skills that the intern has displayed consistently. Their ability to manage workshops and oversee children's theater productions speaks to their leadership and project management capabilities. 

Moreover, with a strong academic background in Music and various teaching experiences, they bring a creative perspective that enriches collaborative environments. Their commitment to fostering artistic growth in others is commendable, and I foresee great success for them in their future endeavors within the performing arts field.
