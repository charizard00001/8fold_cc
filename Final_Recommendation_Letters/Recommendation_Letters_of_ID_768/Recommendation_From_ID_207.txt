As the Government Relations, Communications, and Organizational Development Director, I have had the pleasure of working closely with an exceptionally talented individual who has excelled as an Arts Education Intern. Her ability to engage and inspire students in arts education has left a lasting impact. Throughout her internship, she has demonstrated remarkable dedication by teaching workshops on opera and creating study materials that deepen students’ understanding of the performing arts.

Her experience as a Director of children's theater workshops showcases her leadership and organizational skills, effectively managing numerous young talents while facilitating a seamless production process. Additionally, her academic excellence, reflected in a 3.99 GPA, underscores her commitment to continuous learning.

Her strong communication abilities and collaborative spirit perfectly complement my role in strategic relationships. I wholeheartedly recommend this talented arts educator for any future opportunities, confident that she will bring creativity, dedication, and exceptional organizational skills to any team.
