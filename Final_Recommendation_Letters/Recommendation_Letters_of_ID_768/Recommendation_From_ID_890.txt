It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend the arts education intern, whose dedication and exceptional skills have been a valuable asset to our programs. With a background in vocal performance and significant experience teaching music, they have not only excelled in conducting workshops for local schools but have also demonstrated a passion for fostering the growth of young artists. Their ability to create engaging learning experiences showcases their commitment to music education.

In my role as a dental hygienist, I prioritize the education and care of my patients, paralleling the intern's focus on guiding students through the world of opera and performing arts. The intern's meticulous attention to detail and organizational skills have shone through during their projects, aligning well with my commitment to patient care and education in dental hygiene. Their collaborative spirit and eagerness to learn make them an exceptional candidate for any opportunity in the arts education field.
