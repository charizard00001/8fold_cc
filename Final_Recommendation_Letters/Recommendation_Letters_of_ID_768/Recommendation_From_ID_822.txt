Having had the opportunity to work closely with an exceptional individual, I am pleased to provide a recommendation for an Arts Education Intern. My background involved customer service and team management within the retail industry, where fostering strong working relationships and ensuring a positive environment were paramount. This individual exemplified these qualities as they taught workshops on opera to local schools, showcasing their ability to engage and inspire young minds.

Their organizational skills were readily apparent while assisting in student matineés, reflecting a dedication to education and the arts. The blend of their educational accomplishments, like a Bachelor's in Music with a striking GPA, alongside practical experience in guidance and teaching, highlights their remarkable capabilities. They consistently demonstrated the ability to juggle multiple responsibilities while maintaining a focus on delivering high-quality experiences for students. I have no doubt they will excel in any endeavor they undertake, bringing the same enthusiasm and professionalism they exhibited during our time together.
