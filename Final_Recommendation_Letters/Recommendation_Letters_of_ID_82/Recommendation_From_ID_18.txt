Having had the privilege of working closely with a dedicated and skilled individual in the field of information technology, I am excited to recommend someone whose impressive capabilities make them an invaluable asset. My experience as a Support and Network Services Intern allowed me to witness firsthand the essential skills and adaptability displayed. This individual not only customized and implemented Microsoft SCSM, enhancing the efficiency of the Student Affairs department, but also actively collaborated with the Network & Support Services team to address user needs. 

Transitioning into the role of an Information Technology Coordinator, this individual has excelled in overseeing extensive projects, including the successful implementation of a $300,000 ERP system. Their extensive technical expertise, exceptional problem-solving skills, and proven ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical staff have been pivotal in optimizing business processes and ensuring user satisfaction. I wholeheartedly endorse this candidate for any future endeavors, as they demonstrate a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
