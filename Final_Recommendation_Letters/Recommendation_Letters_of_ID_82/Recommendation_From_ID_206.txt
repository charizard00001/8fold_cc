Having worked as a Financial Analyst at AIG, I have had the pleasure of collaborating closely with an Information Technology Coordinator whose expertise significantly enhanced our operational efficiency. Over the years, the IT Coordinator has led numerous projects, including a $300,000 implementation of the Navision ERP system and the design of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, which ultimately streamlined our business processes.

Their ability to bridge the gap between technology and finance has been invaluable, providing solutions that increased productivity for our 150-person team. This individual's problem-solving skills and unwavering professionalism have made them the go-to person for technology-related issues. They possess impressive communication skills, allowing for seamless collaboration between management and staff. I wholeheartedly recommend this IT Coordinator, whose dedication to continuous improvement and ability to adapt to evolving challenges has been a significant asset to our organization. Their contributions will undoubtedly bring value to any team they join.
