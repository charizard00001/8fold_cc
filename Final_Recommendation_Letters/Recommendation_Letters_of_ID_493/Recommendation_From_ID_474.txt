As a landscaper managing over 200 properties, I have had the privilege of working alongside a dedicated professional in aircraft sales. This individual has an impressive background in both construction management and aviation, demonstrating strong leadership and organizational skills. With over 17 years in construction, including experience as an owner-operator of an industrial welding company, they bring a wealth of knowledge in managing complex projects and leading diverse teams.

In their current role in aircraft sales, they diligently research and investigate aircraft compliance and valuation, ensuring meticulous attention to detail and adherence to FAA standards. Their ability to analyze data and communicate effectively has contributed significantly to their success in the aviation industry. 

Their commitment to professional development, combined with their educational achievements—a bachelor's and master's degree in aviation and human factors—underscores a strong work ethic and dedication to excellence. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any opportunities where their expertise can be further utilized and appreciated.
