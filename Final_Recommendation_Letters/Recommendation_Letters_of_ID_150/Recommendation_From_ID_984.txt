With over 15 years of experience in Military Healthcare, I have developed a strong skill set in clinical management and patient relations as a Medical Support Assistant. My proven ability to manage multiple responsibilities and coordinate care for Veterans has honed my leadership and communication skills. During my tenure, I have consistently strived for excellence, which has prepared me to recommend a professional of exceptional caliber: a Director of Applications in Healthcare IT.

The Director has a remarkable background in managing healthcare IT applications and effectively leading teams. Their strategic approach to budget management and project implementation has resulted in significant cost savings and operational improvements. Notably, they excel in navigating complex systems to enhance workflow and patient care, successfully reducing the number of redundant applications in their organization. The Director's commitment to exceptional customer service and proactive leadership makes them an invaluable asset to any healthcare team, ensuring the highest standards of care and efficiency.
