As an Information Technology Manager with extensive experience in overseeing IT operations and support for a college, I have had the privilege of witnessing exemplary talent in action. During a recent internship, a promising individual demonstrated strong analytical skills while examining user-system interactions in a demanding healthcare environment. Their ability to navigate various departments, including the Emergency Room and Pharmacy, showcased not only adaptability but also a commitment to enhancing user experience through technology.

Additionally, this person’s background in business management—culminating in an MBA—equipped them with a unique perspective on aligning technology solutions with business needs. Their work as a Business Analyst further highlighted their capacity to engage stakeholders and drive projects that increase user satisfaction and operational efficiency. I fully endorse their potential as an analyst, confident they will bring insight and innovation to any organization lucky enough to have them.
