As the Deputy Director of Information Technology, I have had the privilege to observe the professional growth of an outstanding individual during their internship. With a background in Business Administration and Information Management, this individual exhibited remarkable analytical skills and a proactive approach while working in various hospital departments. Their ability to identify and resolve problems between users and systems highlighted their foundational understanding of technology and its application in the healthcare sector. 

Beyond the technical skills, this individual has a strong work ethic, showcased during their time as a Business Analyst, where they demonstrated creativity in promoting projects and enhancing user engagement effectively. Their multilingual capabilities add further value in diverse environments. Given their experience and passion for technology and business solutions, I strongly recommend this individual for any analyst position. I am confident they will bring the same dedication and innovative thinking to future endeavors as they have during their internship.
