Having known the Library Educational Aide for years, I wholeheartedly recommend her for any administrative or customer service role. My own experience as a Customer Service Advocate II involved leading operations at a busy utility office and later providing high-quality support in healthcare at BlueCross BlueShield. Throughout our professional journeys, I have observed the remarkable versatility and dedication she displays in her work.

Her background in education, combined with a decade of customer service experience, allows her to create supportive environments for students and staff alike. The administrative and organizational skills needed to manage library accounts and assist with various school needs perfectly align with the demands of any fast-paced office setting. The collaborative and resourceful nature she exhibits ensures she builds strong relationships with colleagues and clients. Her problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and commitment to exceptional service resonate well with the qualities that define outstanding professionals. I am confident she will be an excellent asset in any endeavor she pursues.
