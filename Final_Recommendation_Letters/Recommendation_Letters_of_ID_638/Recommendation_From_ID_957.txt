As a dedicated Merchant Services Advocate with extensive experience in customer relations, team management, and problem-solving, it has been a pleasure to observe the professional growth of a Customer Advocate who consistently strives for excellence in her role. With a strong foundation built from her time in R.O.T.C, she has developed exceptional leadership, teamwork, and initiative skills which are evident in her work. During her tenure as a Customer Advocate, she efficiently managed customer accounts, ensuring compliance and accuracy while fostering a welcoming environment for clients.

Her commitment to customer satisfaction and effective communication complements my experience in building strong merchant relationships and enhancing customer experiences. Both of us share a passion for delivering exceptional service and solving complex issues. I confidently recommend her for any role that demands strong interpersonal skills and a proactive approach to customer care, as she possesses the qualities that make her an invaluable asset to any team.
