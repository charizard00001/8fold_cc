As the Director of Information Technology, I had the privilege of collaborating with a remarkable Vice President of Information Technology. Throughout my tenure, I often directed efforts toward improving the City of Greensboro's technology infrastructure, where a well-rounded strategic partner was essential. The Vice President was instrumental in bridging the gap between IT and business strategy, effectively transforming technology into a key competitive advantage.

Their adeptness in managing complex IT environments, combined with a results-oriented approach to IT budgeting and operations, has led to substantial cost savings and enhanced service delivery. Under their leadership, our organizations witnessed the successful deployment of innovative business intelligence practices, comprehensive disaster recovery plans, and seamless transitions during significant operational shifts. The Vice President’s commitment to excellence and an impressive track record in team building and systems management make them an invaluable asset to any organization. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any future endeavor.
