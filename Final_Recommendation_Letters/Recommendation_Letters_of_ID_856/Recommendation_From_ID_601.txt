Rachael Lobdell has extensive experience as a Senior Outreach Advocate, dedicating over 13 years to enhancing the health and dignity of vulnerable populations through effective community education and support. With her compassionate approach and strong communication skills, she has excelled in evaluating clients' needs and facilitating access to necessary services. Rachael’s expertise in managing Medicaid applications and her ability to analyze healthcare documentation have positively impacted many lives, making her a true asset in the healthcare sector.

On the other hand, the HR Volunteer Assistant Manager brings a diverse skill set in human resource management, enhanced by an ongoing pursuit of an MBA, focusing on business operations, conflict resolution, and staff development. Their dedication to ethical organizational practices aligns perfectly with Rachael’s commitment to client advocacy and wellbeing. Together, they exemplify how compassionate leadership and strong management principles can transform organizations and communities alike. I highly recommend the HR Volunteer Assistant Manager for any management roles in healthcare, as they would undoubtedly contribute to improving service delivery and organizational efficiency.
