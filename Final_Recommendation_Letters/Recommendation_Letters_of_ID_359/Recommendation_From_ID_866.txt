I highly recommend a talented consultant who has significantly enriched our team with their expertise in project management and application support. Currently managing complex data collection and GIS system updates, they effectively coordinate remote staff and enhance productivity through detailed reports—skills that align with their extensive experience in utility solutions. Prior roles included leading system configurations and providing application support for critical software tools in municipal environments.

Notably, there is a commendable synergy with my background in IT management, where meticulous planning and troubleshooting were crucial to executing IT projects and enhancing a client’s online presence. Their adeptness in developing secure scripts and maintaining departmental web interfaces after a ransomware incident further exemplifies their proactive approach to safeguarding operational integrity. The blend of our experiences in IT management and consulting makes for a robust collaboration, and I wholeheartedly vouch for their capabilities in any endeavor they pursue.
