Having worked closely with a dedicated individual in my role at Michael's Arts and Crafts Store, I can confidently recommend a talented professional in the medical field who is seeking to expand her career. Throughout my time managing various store operations, I witnessed an exceptional display of communication and customer service skills that could be invaluable in a clinical environment.

The certified nurse assistant has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to patient care, effectively managing stress and handling escalated situations with composure. Her extensive experience in patient assessment and comfort, alongside her proficiency in managing administrative tasks and medical terminology, showcases her ability to thrive in fast-paced settings. Her background as a team player complements my own experience in leadership and training within a customer-focused environment. I believe she would be an outstanding asset in any clinical position, and I wholeheartedly support her pursuit of a new opportunity in healthcare.
