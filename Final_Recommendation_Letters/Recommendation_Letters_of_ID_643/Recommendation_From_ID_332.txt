Having worked as a Project Accountant on various high-stakes projects funded by organizations like the United States Army Corps of Engineers and USAID, I can confidently recommend a talented individual who was my intern during my tenure. This intern possesses a unique blend of operational experience and people skills, essential for successful collaboration within multi-cultural business environments. Their time as a Sales & Trading Intern involved working with senior leaders, conducting asset analysis, and engaging high-net-worth clients, showcasing their adaptability and keen understanding of finance and trading.

The value they add through their capacity for detailed market analysis and client relations is commendable. I believe that their entrepreneurial mindset and exposure to diverse business cultures will serve them well in any future endeavors. I strongly encourage considering this individual for opportunities that require strong analytical and interpersonal skills, as they have the potential to excel and contribute significantly.
