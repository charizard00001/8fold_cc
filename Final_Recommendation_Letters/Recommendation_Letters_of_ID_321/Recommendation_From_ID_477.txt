As a Budget and Administration Manager, I had the privilege of working closely with a talented Theater Arts Teacher and Program Director who exemplifies dedication and passion in education. Over her six-year career, she has successfully developed and managed a comprehensive Theater Arts program, showcasing her strong communication skills and ability to inspire students. Her experience as a U.I.L. One Act Play Director demonstrates her commitment to fostering talent and creativity in young artists.

In my role overseeing a $3M budget, I witnessed her meticulous attention to organizational detail and her effective collaboration with various stakeholders, which ensured program sustainability. Her ability to manage club activities and funds reflects her strong administrative competencies. Furthermore, her continuous professional development and engagement in extracurricular activities, such as serving as a Drama Club Sponsor and participating in student council events, illustrate her commitment to mentoring students beyond the classroom. Her leadership qualities and collaborative spirit would make her an invaluable asset to any educational institution.
