Having worked in the financial services industry for over a decade, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with an exceptionally talented Director of Information Technology. This individual has been pivotal in transforming the IT landscape for the City of Greensboro by implementing innovative solutions that have streamlined operations and significantly enhanced service delivery. Their leadership not only resulted in substantial cost savings, such as the impressive $400,000 generated annually through the implementation of VoIP, but also maintained an outstanding 95% customer satisfaction rating.

As a Senior Mortgage Banking Executive, my role required effective partnership with diverse departments, particularly IT, to ensure smooth operations and customer satisfaction. The Director's ability to foster collaboration and improve efficiencies has directly contributed to the business's success. They possess a rare combination of technical expertise and exceptional leadership skills, making them an invaluable asset to any organization. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any ambitious IT leadership role.
