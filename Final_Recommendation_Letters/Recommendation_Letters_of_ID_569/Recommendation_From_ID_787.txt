Having collaborated as colleagues in our respective fields, I wholeheartedly recommend the union president as an exemplary leader and advocate. As an operator with extensive experience in production environments—ranging from wave soldering to mechanical assembly—I recognize the significance of effective operations management, a strength that the union president consistently demonstrates.

The union president's proven ability to navigate high-pressure situations with poise, combined with exceptional skills in contract negotiation and process improvement, has profoundly benefited our team. Their commitment to staff development, comprehensive training initiatives, and meticulous attention to detail has not only fostered a cooperative atmosphere but also enhanced operational efficiency. Moreover, their leadership within AFSCME has significantly contributed to the betterment of labor relations and employee advocacy.

In my experience, the union president's capabilities in fostering collaboration and improving processes have positively impacted all those around them, making them an invaluable asset to any organization.
