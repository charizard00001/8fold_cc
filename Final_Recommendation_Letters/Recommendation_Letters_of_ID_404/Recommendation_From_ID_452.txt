Having worked alongside an accomplished Finance Officer for several years, I wholeheartedly recommend her for any position in the accounting and finance field. As someone who transitioned from a Junior Auditor to a Finance position, I had the opportunity to witness her mastery in financial management and her remarkable organizational skills firsthand. Over her 25-year career, she has excelled in various accounting roles, including significant contributions as the Finance Officer and Acting Bureau of Internal Revenue Representative at the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco, where she remarkably increased income tax collections by 500%.

Her ability to manage large sums of money while maintaining precise financial records is unmatched. With her extensive background in budget management and auditing, she embodies the qualities of a diligent and dependable professional. Her excellent communication skills and team-oriented approach make her an invaluable asset. I am confident that she will excel in her future endeavors, bringing exceptional value to any organization she joins.
