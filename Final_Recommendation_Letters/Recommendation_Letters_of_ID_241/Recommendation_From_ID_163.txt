As a Certified Custom Framer with a strong commitment to outstanding customer service and multitasking, I have had the pleasure of witnessing the dedication and skills of a remarkable individual who has operated as a Full-Time Student and an exceptional intern. Drawing from twenty-four years of military service, this individual has cultivated an extraordinary ability to manage diverse groups, deliver training programs, and communicate effectively—qualities that are essential in both fields.

While excelling in their role at the U.S. Army, they honed skills in time management, organizational communication, and team building, reinforcing their capacity to mentor and guide others. Their impressive educational accomplishments, including graduating Cum Laude, reflect a commitment to excellence that is equally apparent in their practical experiences. The ability to synthesize information and present complex subjects clearly makes this individual an invaluable asset, and I wholeheartedly recommend their expertise and professionalism.
