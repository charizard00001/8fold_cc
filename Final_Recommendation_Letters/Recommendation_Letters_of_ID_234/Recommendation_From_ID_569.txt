Having served as the AFSCME Union President during a successful career in operations management, I have had the privilege of working with an exceptional colleague and professional in the field of unmanned aviation. This colleague has demonstrated remarkable leadership as the Unmanned Aviation Technician Supervisor, effectively managing military logistics and operations. Their experience in overseeing teams, coupled with a strong focus on communication and collaboration, greatly complements my background in contract negotiation and staff training.

This individual has displayed impressive problem-solving skills while coordinating logistics for military operations, ensuring compliance with safety regulations and meeting critical timelines. Their ability to develop relationships with both customers and team members is commendable, and I have no doubt that they apply the same level of dedication and organization to their work that I have seen in my own role. I wholeheartedly recommend this professional for any opportunity, as they possess the skills and commitment necessary for success in any endeavor.
