As a Mechanical Design Engineer Intern, I had the privilege of working alongside an exceptional Office Manager who demonstrated remarkable organizational skills and efficiency over her impressive 13-year career. Her role was crucial in maintaining the operational effectiveness of our office, as she expertly managed payroll processing, budget maintenance, and compliance with hospital and federal regulations, ensuring smooth day-to-day functions. Her ability to harmonize the needs of both clinical staff and management played a pivotal role in fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

While I focused on technical aspects related to product design and analysis, her constant support in administrative tasks allowed our engineering team to maintain focus on project deliverables. Her proactive approach led to cost reductions and the implementation of innovative filing systems that significantly improved our workflows. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any opportunities that align with her extensive skill set, confident that she will deliver excellence as she has consistently done in her career.
