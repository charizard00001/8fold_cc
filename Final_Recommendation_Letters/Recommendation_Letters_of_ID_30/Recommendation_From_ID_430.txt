Having worked closely with a dedicated Project Accountant, I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for their exceptional skills and commitment to excellence. In their current role overseeing the accounting aspects of significant construction projects, such as the Gulfport High School renovation, they have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manage multiple tasks while efficiently coordinating financial activities. This person’s proficiency in accounting systems such as AS400, SAP, and JD Edwards significantly enhances project deliverables, ensuring accurate invoicing and timely payments.

I have witnessed firsthand their strong interpersonal skills and organizational acumen, which are vital in collaborating with Project Managers and Engineers. Their previous experience, which includes developing procedural manuals and managing multimillion-dollar contracts, further illustrates their depth of knowledge and expertise in project accounting. It is this blend of accounting insight and project management experience that makes them an invaluable asset to any team, and I am confident they will excel in future endeavors.
