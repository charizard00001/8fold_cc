As a Senior Accountant, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a highly dedicated Project Accountant who has consistently demonstrated remarkable skills in managing construction-related financial activities. This individual currently serves as the on-site Project Accountant for significant renovation projects, such as the Gulfport High School renovation. With their strong knowledge of accounting systems like AS400 and SAP, they manage various accounting tasks, including AIA pay applications and owner billings.

Their ability to coordinate multiple project elements, such as subcontracts and purchase orders, while assisting project managers reflects not only their organizational skills but also their commitment to achieving project goals. This professional is proactive and results-oriented, often serving as a vital link between various stakeholders to ensure smooth operations. The depth of experience in project accounting and a keen eye for detail makes them a valuable asset. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any role requiring expertise in project accounting and financial management.
