I am pleased to recommend a talented K-12 Principal whose leadership and educational expertise have consistently made a significant impact in the academic community. Having transitioned from an accomplished career in language arts education, where she inspired students and coordinated effective teaching strategies, she now excels in a leadership role, fostering professional growth among educators and implementing innovative programs that enhance student learning.

Her role as a Principal has been marked by the development of a comprehensive morning intervention program and a positive behavior support system across multiple school levels. Collaborating closely with teachers and stakeholders, her commitment to building authentic relationships has not only strengthened the community but also empowered educators to drive instruction using data.

Her collaborative spirit and strategic approach to leadership mirror the operational excellence and team-oriented focus seen in the packaging industry, where she would find great synergy with her counterpart. It is with confidence that I recommend her, as she embodies the qualities needed to excel in any educational leadership capacity.
