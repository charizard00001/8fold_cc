Having served as a bank teller, I can confidently recommend an individual who is currently working as a Non-Commissioned Security Officer. In my role, I've honed my ability to provide exceptional customer service and build rapport with clients, skills that are mirrored in this individual’s commitment to security and vigilance. Their experience as a security officer showcases a robust work ethic and the ability to handle various challenges professionally, from managing surveillance systems to executing emergency protocols.

Furthermore, their military background as a Petty Officer has equipped them with essential skills in leadership and teamwork, qualities that are invaluable in any professional setting. The combination of their technical knowledge in operating systems and their practical experience in security positions indicates a well-rounded individual who is adaptable and resourceful. I have no doubt that they will bring the same dedication and meticulous attention to detail in any technology-based role they pursue.
