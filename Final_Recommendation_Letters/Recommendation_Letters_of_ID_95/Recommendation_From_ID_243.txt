As a seasoned Field Project Supervisor with over 26 years in aviation logistics, I have had the pleasure of working alongside a promising talent in the aviation industry. The individual currently serves as a Line Service Technician, where he actively engages in fueling and managing aircraft operations, showcasing his dedication to the field. His commitment to aviation is not only evident in his hands-on experience but also in his pursuit of a Private Pilot Certificate while studying for an Associate's degree in Aviation Pilot Training.

His strong communication skills and technical understanding, combined with my leadership experience overseeing critical aviation programs, speak volumes about his potential. I genuinely believe that his eagerness to learn and his established work ethic will serve him well as he progresses further into his aviation career. I wholeheartedly recommend him for any opportunities that will allow him to develop his skills and grow in the aviation sector.
