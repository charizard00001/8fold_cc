Having served as a Gunnery Sergeant for over 16 years, the foundational skills in leadership, resource management, and detailed project execution have equipped a strong professional character. In this role, responsibilities included managing personnel and overseeing extensive IT systems for thousands of users, which demanded not only technical proficiency but also the ability to coordinate complex logistical operations under pressure. This experience in military operations and IT transition provided a robust understanding of systems management and team dynamics.

Transitioning into the role of Superintendent II, there is evident alignment in capabilities. Despite different operational focuses, the commitment to safety, efficiency, and management shines through in both positions. The Superintendent's role entailed overseeing substantial equipment worth millions, mirroring the acute accountability and resource allocation skills previously honed. With a shared background in U.S. military operations and a proven track record of leadership, the combination of these experiences makes for an exceptional professional with the capability to drive success in demanding environments.
