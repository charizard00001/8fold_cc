Having served alongside an exceptional individual, I am pleased to recommend a dedicated professional transitioning to a Social Services Provider role. As a fellow military veteran, I worked as a Maintenance Specialist at TWPC and witnessed firsthand the profound impact of effective leadership and communication skills. This individual not only demonstrated remarkable proficiency in maintaining complex infantry systems as a Specialist of Infantry but also developed the ability to identify and address social and personal barriers that affect underemployed veterans and the disabled.

With a robust educational background, including a Master of Arts in Education, they are equipped to design community-based services that bridge gaps for underserved groups. Their experience in occupational consulting, technical writing, and information systems positions them uniquely to deliver impactful support and resources. This individual embodies a commitment to service, making them invaluable to any organization focused on enhancing the lives of others. I have no doubt they will excel in their next role, bringing dedication and expertise to the field.
