Having had the privilege to work alongside a dedicated intern in the field of exercise science, I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for future opportunities. During the internship, they effectively created and implemented strength and conditioning workouts, demonstrating a deep understanding of exercise principles and client engagement. Their attention to detail in monitoring lifting form and technique contributed to the safety and effectiveness of training programs, which aligns seamlessly with the responsibilities I manage as a Clinical Study Coordinator II overseeing diverse clinical trials.

The intern's experience in client interaction and their capability to organize and prepare equipment reflected an impressive level of professionalism and dedication, traits that are invaluable in both clinical research and exercise science. Their background in health promotion and education complements their hands-on experience, further enhancing their qualifications. I firmly believe their skills and work ethic will make them a significant asset in any future endeavor, particularly in environments focused on improving health outcomes.
