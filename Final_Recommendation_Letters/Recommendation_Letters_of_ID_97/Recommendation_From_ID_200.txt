Having served as an Aviation Supply Specialist for over a decade, I am consistently impressed by the leadership and expertise demonstrated by the Director of Aviation and Safety. This individual has a remarkable ability to meld strategic thinking with practical applications, as evidenced by their role advising the Adjutant General for all Army aviation activities in the Montana Army National Guard. Their extensive background in aviation, combined with a strong emphasis on safety management and accident investigation, makes them an invaluable resource in our field.

The dedication to logistical management and ground and air readiness is further complemented by their commitment to training development and employee relations, fostering a culture of safety and collaboration. I have witnessed their proactive approach in developing training relationships with various agencies to effectively respond to emergencies. This combination of technical skills and leadership qualities ensures that they can successfully navigate complex aviation environments while maintaining the highest standards of safety and efficiency.
