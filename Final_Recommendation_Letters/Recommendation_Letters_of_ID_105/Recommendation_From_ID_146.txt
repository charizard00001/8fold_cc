Having worked alongside a highly skilled Operations Manager, I am compelled to recommend an exemplary Preventative Healthcare Intern. The Operations Manager expertise spans over 28 years in healthcare management and business operations, where they oversaw financial systems, employee development, and program implementation in multiple sites. Their extensive experience has honed exceptional leadership qualities, strategic planning skills, and a deep understanding of operations that shaped a productive and compliant work environment.

The Preventative Healthcare Intern, fresh from their Bachelor’s degree, demonstrates a passionate commitment to patient wellness and a solid foundation in healthcare practices. Their ability to assist in planning and implementing community health events reflects a proactive approach to health education. Both individuals embody a patient-focused mentality, with the intern's dedication aligning well with the managerial emphasis on quality improvements and staff empowerment. Their collaborative nature and strong work ethic ensure that they can significantly contribute to any healthcare team.
