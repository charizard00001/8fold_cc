I am pleased to recommend an outstanding individual who has shown remarkable dedication and passion as an ABA Therapist. With a bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Purdue University, this professional brings a strong foundation in behavioral sciences. During their internship, they worked diligently with children, diligently implementing treatment plans and maintaining detailed records to track each child's progress. Their ability to foster professional relationships with families, teachers, and fellow therapists demonstrates excellent teamwork and communication skills, essential in our field.

Having spent over 30 years as a Director of Information Technology, I can confidently appreciate the importance of collaborative approaches in diverse working environments, much like the one I cultivated among the IT teams at the Port of New Orleans. Both roles emphasize a commitment to meeting individual needs, whether in educational or technological settings. This individual’s proactive and compassionate nature ensures they make a significant, positive impact on the lives of those they work with, and I wholeheartedly endorse their capabilities.
