Having worked as an Information Technology and AWS Admin Intern, I have had the opportunity to interact with numerous skilled professionals, but few have impressed me as much as a former colleague who served as an ABA Therapist. This individual demonstrated exceptional dedication and empathy while working one-on-one with children, closely following behavior and treatment plans. Their ability to establish solid professional relationships with both families and other therapists speaks volumes about their interpersonal skills.

In addition to their work in behavioral therapy, this person has shown a commitment to personal growth and teamwork, as evidenced by their leadership roles during university and community service activities. Their compassionate and enthusiastic approach to helping others, combined with strong organizational skills, makes them a valuable asset in any team. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any position, confident that they will make a positive impact and contribute to any organization they join.
