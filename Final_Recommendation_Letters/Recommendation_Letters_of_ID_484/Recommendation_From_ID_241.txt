Having dedicated years to military service as a Tank Platoon Sergeant, I have had the privilege of witnessing exemplary leadership in action. During my tenure, I worked closely with a remarkable Combat Marksmanship Trainer and Primary Marksmanship Instructor, who has proven to be an invaluable asset in the training of Marines. This individual expertly instructed over 2,000 Marines in the Marine Corps Marksmanship Program, demonstrating a profound understanding of small arms and tactics, along with an unwavering commitment to safety.

Their ability to analyze and troubleshoot issues during live fire exercises showcased not only their technical expertise but also their capability in mentoring other service members. Commended for outstanding performance, they have consistently exhibited the qualities of a great leader, ensuring effective training and operational readiness. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any role that demands dedication, skill, and leadership in high-pressure environments. Their proven track record makes them an exceptional candidate for any position related to training and development.
