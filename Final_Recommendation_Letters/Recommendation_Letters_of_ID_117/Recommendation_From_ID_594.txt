As the Director of Information Technology with over 13 years of leadership experience, I had the pleasure of collaborating closely with an exceptional ASP.NET Web Developer, who consistently demonstrated an impressive work ethic and technical excellence. During their tenure, they successfully migrated a complex IU Print website from ColdFusion to ASP.NET, showcasing their expertise in modern frameworks and their ability to handle significant projects meticulously.

This developer played a crucial role in a number of team achievements, including the eRFA and DEBTS projects, which streamlined processes and improved system functionalities for our clients. Their keen understanding of software engineering and efficient database management complemented our IT initiatives perfectly, enabling us to enhance productivity and user engagement significantly. 

I highly recommend this talented individual for any future endeavors, confident that they will bring the same level of innovation and dedication to your organization as they have in ours. Their skills in coding, project management, and team collaboration will undoubtedly prove invaluable.
