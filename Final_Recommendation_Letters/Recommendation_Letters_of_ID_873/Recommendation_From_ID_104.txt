Having served as a Bilingual Domestic Violence Advocate, I can confidently recommend the seasoned Charge Nurse for any nursing position in Intake, Case Management, or a Behavioral Health Unit. With over a decade of experience in the fast-paced dual diagnosis and chemical dependency unit, the Charge Nurse has consistently demonstrated expertise in delivering compassionate, holistic care while collaborating effectively with multidisciplinary teams, including social workers, which aligns closely with my own responsibilities in client advocacy.

During my tenure, I worked with diverse populations, assessing needs and providing crisis intervention, skills that complement the Charge Nurse's ability to manage complex cases and de-escalate situations in high-stress environments. The commitment to patient safety and well-being displayed through effective assessment and intervention techniques is commendable and reflects a dedication to improving patient outcomes. Their strong interpersonal skills and understanding of trauma-informed care will be invaluable assets in any healthcare setting.
