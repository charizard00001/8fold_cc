As a Project Accountant with extensive experience in managing complex construction-related financial tasks, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with Virginia, a dedicated and capable Staff Accountant at Cypress Healthcare Partners. My role has often required working closely with project managers and engineers to address financial concerns, an area where Virginia's expertise in managing diverse accounting functions has proven invaluable.

Virginia's meticulous attention to detail and her proficiency in overseeing the monthly financial reporting for multiple medical groups highlight her strong organizational skills and ability to handle complex projects under pressure. Her experience reconciling accounts and her dedication to financial accuracy and compliance have set a high standard in our field. Virginia is a natural leader who fosters a collaborative work environment, making her a strong team player and mentor for her colleagues. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any opportunities requiring a skilled accountant with an unwavering work ethic and exceptional project management capabilities.
