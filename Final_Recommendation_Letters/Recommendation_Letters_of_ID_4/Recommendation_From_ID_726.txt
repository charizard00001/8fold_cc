Having worked alongside Virginia in the accounting field for several years, I am pleased to recommend her for any accounting position. As a Staff Accountant in a management company for doctor offices, Virginia handles comprehensive accounting functions, including financial reporting for multiple medical groups. Her meticulous attention to detail and organizational skills ensure that every financial statement is accurate and timely, contributing significantly to our teams’ success.

I have served as a Staff Accountant supporting various church locations, where I manage high-volume financial transactions and generate monthly financial statements. The expertise Virginia demonstrates in reconciling complex accounts and her hands-on supervisory experience are traits that complement my background in accounting. She is proactive, consistently meets deadlines, and effectively collaborates within a team. This strong work ethic, combined with her ability to thrive under tight deadlines, makes her an invaluable asset to any organization.
