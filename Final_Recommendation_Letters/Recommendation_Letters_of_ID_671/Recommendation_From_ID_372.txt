As a seasoned HR Manager who has successfully partnered with various business units, I have had the privilege of working alongside a dedicated individual who embodies the spirit of service and excellence through coaching. In his role as Assistant Boy's Basketball Coach, he not only analyzes team dynamics and implements match strategies, but also fosters personal growth among athletes, emphasizing teamwork and resilience.

His commitment to nurturing young talent is evident in the way he integrates his Christian faith with his coaching philosophy, aiming to uplift and inspire those around him. Beyond his coaching expertise, he brings a wealth of organizational and management skills from previous roles, such as serving as a bank examiner and an assistant professor. His ability to effectively manage both teams and individuals, coupled with his passion for developing athletes, makes him an invaluable asset to any organization or team. His work strongly resonates with the values of integrity, leadership, and community development.
