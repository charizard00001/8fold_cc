As an Information Technology Manager with extensive experience in managing complex IT projects, I highly recommend the Head of Information Technology and Information Center for their visionary leadership and expertise. Throughout their impressive two-decade career, this individual has consistently demonstrated an ability to innovate and execute on ambitious technology strategies while leading sizable teams and managing multi-million dollar budgets. Their role as Schering-Plough's first SAP Center of Excellence leader speaks volumes about their capability to drive transformational business processes through technology.

I had the privilege of witnessing their collaborative style and outstanding communication skills, which foster a culture of teamwork and high performance. With a strong focus on analytics and strategic direction, they have brought significant value to the organizations they led. Their remarkable ability to harmonize technology with business objectives makes them an exceptional asset for any organization seeking to enhance its IT capabilities and improve overall efficiency.
