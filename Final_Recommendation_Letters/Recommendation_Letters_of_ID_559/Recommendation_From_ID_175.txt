Having witnessed the remarkable growth and development of a motivated individual whose strong work ethic shines brightly, I can confidently recommend the recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Economics and a minor in Finance. This individual participated in a banking boot camp, showing a commitment to understanding the financial industry and its intricacies. Their experience as a Front End Supervisor and Cashier speaks volumes about their ability to manage customer interactions with grace and efficiency.

In contrast, my background as a Banking Manager has allowed me to cultivate high-performing teams and drive sales through exceptional customer service. I have overseen operations that consistently exceeded revenue goals, emphasizing the importance of training and motivation in a success-driven environment. The strong foundation established in economics, paired with hands-on service experience, suggests that this recent graduate is well-prepared to contribute positively to any banking institution. I fully believe they will excel within any team they join.
