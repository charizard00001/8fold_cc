Having worked as a Finance and Sales Consultant, I am pleased to recommend a highly skilled Finance Coordinator who demonstrates exceptional expertise in managing financial operations. My background involved training new hires in finance and sales, while maintaining superior customer service and closing rates, illustrating my commitment to professional excellence.

The Finance Coordinator excels in accounting and payroll processing, with strong organizational and communication skills. Their proficiency in maintaining accurate accounts, preparing bank reconciliations, and managing bi-weekly payroll for over 30 employees showcases their attention to detail and reliability. Their ability to handle complex financial systems, including ADP and Paychex, complements their understanding of payroll regulations and fiscal budgeting.

Together, both our roles required a keen understanding of finance, customer relations, and effective communication. I am confident that the Finance Coordinator's skills are invaluable assets to any organization, and I wholeheartedly endorse them for future opportunities.
