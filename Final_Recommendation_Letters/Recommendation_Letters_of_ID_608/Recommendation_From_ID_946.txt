Having worked as a Sales Associate for several years, I have developed a diverse set of skills in customer relations, problem solving, and leadership. My experience in fast-paced environments, such as retail and food service, has honed my ability to communicate effectively and assist a wide range of customers. It’s with great confidence that I recommend a talented Home Healthcare Technician who embodies the same dedication to service I value.

In her role, she has excelled in providing compassionate care to chronically ill patients, demonstrating both professionalism and an exceptional ability to foster positive relationships. Her extensive experience in patient care, combined with certifications as a Nursing Assistant and in Phlebotomy, truly showcase her commitment to the healthcare field. Her strong organizational skills and ability to remain calm under pressure are assets that would benefit any medical facility looking for a reliable and caring team member. She genuinely cares for her patients and is eager to contribute to a health care setting.
