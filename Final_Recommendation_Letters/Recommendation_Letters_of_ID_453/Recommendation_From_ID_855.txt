Having worked closely with an exceptional Electrical Engineer, I am pleased to recommend this individual for any future endeavors. This engineer demonstrated unparalleled technical expertise in designing and managing power systems within the oil and gas industry. Their ability to coordinate complex projects, such as the successful management of frac pump and chemical unit projects, underscored a strong project management capability that consistently led to significant operational improvements and reductions in downtime.

The leadership qualities exhibited are mirrored in my own experience as an Aviation Maintenance Egress Leading Petty Officer, where I managed teams in high-pressure environments, ensuring both safety and quality in aircraft operations. Both backgrounds emphasize the importance of thorough technical documentation, compliance with safety standards, and the ability to effectively lead and instruct personnel. The commitment to excellence in technical and management roles has always created a positive impact in any project or team setting, making collaboration with such talent a remarkable experience.
