Having witnessed firsthand the dedication and skill of a talented intern, I wholeheartedly recommend Aaditya for any business analyst role. During his internship at a financial firm, he demonstrated strong analytical abilities and applied advanced statistical methods using R and SAS to help predict stock trends and analyze complex datasets. His projects, including forecasting Netflix's daily stock price and predicting lightning strikes, showcased not only his technical expertise but also his excellent organizational and leadership skills.

Aaditya possesses exceptional problem-solving capabilities, which would be invaluable in the tech-driven environment that he is pursuing. His experience as a president of the Chinese Students' Association reflects his team-building skills and his customer-oriented approach is evident from his time providing support to clients. His background aligns perfectly with the requirements needed in roles such as a Senior Technical Business Analyst, where both technical and business acumen are critical for success. I am confident he will excel in any challenge he undertakes.
