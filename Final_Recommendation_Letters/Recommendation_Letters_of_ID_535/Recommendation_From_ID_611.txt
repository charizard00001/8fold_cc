Having worked closely with Kristy Bishop in various capacities, I am pleased to recommend her for any future endeavors. As an entrepreneurial indirect sales executive, Kristy has demonstrated remarkable expertise in new customer acquisition and account management. Her foundational experience as a Relationship Banker II, where she conceptualized a successful marketing campaign yielding a 70% increase in bank deposits, speaks volumes about her results-oriented mindset and innovative approach to driving business.

In my role as Regional Director of Banking and Wealth, I had the opportunity to witness Kristy’s keen ability to build relationships, mentor new hires, and navigate complex market dynamics. Her dedication to client-focused strategies and comprehensive training methodologies has not only benefited her teams but also significantly enhanced customer satisfaction. Kristy's proactive nature and commitment to excellence make her an invaluable asset to any organization, and I am confident she will excel in her future roles, just as she has in the past.
