Having had the privilege to work in the banking sector for several years, I can confidently recommend the talented individual I had the pleasure to mentor during her internship. While I have overseen branch operations as a Branch Manager, this person has gained substantial experience analyzing data and applying statistical methods during her internships at various financial institutions. Her skill set, particularly in R and SAS programming, complements her academic background in statistics, enabling her to contribute valuable insights into financial performance analysis.

Throughout her internship, she diligently collected and analyzed data, providing actionable reports that guided decision-making processes. Moreover, her excellent communication and teamwork capabilities were instrumental in enhancing customer service experiences, while her organizational planning ensured smooth operations. Given her dedication and expertise, I have no doubt that she will excel in any analytical or statistical role, making her an asset to any financial institution.
