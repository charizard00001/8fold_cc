Having worked as an Advanced Level Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a highly talented Graduate Engineer who exhibits exceptional skill and dedication in the field of civil engineering. While I have honed my mechanical expertise in supervising complex repairs and training personnel in the military, I have witnessed the impressive contributions made by this engineer in developing conceptual plans and executing projects with precision.

Through their roles, they showcased a profound understanding of traffic systems and engineering design, employing advanced software tools to optimize designs and enhance functionality. Their ability to coordinate multifaceted projects, like the I-295 Direct Connection, underlines their expertise in mitigating challenges and delivering innovative solutions. Furthermore, their excellent interpersonal skills allow them to effectively communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Their commitment to quality and safety aligns closely with the standards I have upheld in my mechanical career. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any challenging engineering role.
