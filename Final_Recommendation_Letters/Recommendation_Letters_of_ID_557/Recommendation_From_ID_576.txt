As an HR Manager with extensive experience in strategic human resources, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a seasoned Finance Officer who has significantly contributed to our organizational success. With over 25 years of experience, this individual expertly managed financial operations and demonstrated exceptional skills in government accounting, auditing, and budget management. Notably, while serving as the Acting Bureau of Internal Revenue Representative at the Philippine Consulate General, they dramatically increased income tax collections by 500%, showcasing their financial acumen and dedication to operational excellence.

Their work involved meticulous management of financial statements, payroll processing, and budget proposals, consistently ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The Finance Officer’s exceptional organizational skills and commitment to teamwork made them an invaluable asset in our collaborative environment. I wholeheartedly recommend this talented finance professional, confident that their expertise will yield significant benefits in any organization fortunate enough to enlist their services.
