Having worked alongside a highly skilled Finance Manager with extensive experience, I wholeheartedly recommend the capabilities of an exceptional colleague. Currently, this Finance Manager expertly develops financial models for the Professional Lab Services management team and spearheads comprehensive financial analyses, ensuring precise budget forecasting and capital expenditure reviews. Their analytical prowess became evident as they led investigations into underperforming deals, presenting insightful recommendations to senior leadership.

Previously, in a role as Senior Financial Analyst, they partnered with operational leadership to review P&L results and drive significant cost-saving initiatives. A solid foundation in internal auditing, as demonstrated through previous positions, further exemplifies a robust understanding of financial controls and processes.

This Finance Manager not only possesses a wealth of expertise in financial analysis and reporting but also excels at building relationships and communicating effectively within multi-functional teams. Their dedication to streamlining financial operations makes them an asset to any organization, just as they have proven to be in theirs.
