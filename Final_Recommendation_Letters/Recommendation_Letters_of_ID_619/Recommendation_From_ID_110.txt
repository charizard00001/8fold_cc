Having worked as a Project Manager for several years, observing the growth and dedication of a Game Design Intern has been truly inspiring. In my role, I’ve honed skills in managing diverse teams and overseeing complex projects, skills that are crucial in any collaborative environment. The Game Design Intern has demonstrated exceptional ability in teamwork and leadership while managing concessions and overseeing daily operations, crucial experiences that will serve them well in their career.

Their focus on documentation and level design within the game industry showcases a solid understanding of game mechanics and a commitment to quality and organization. Both roles require effective problem-solving abilities and excellent communication skills, which this intern has shown in their interactions with team members and customers alike. I wholeheartedly recommend them for future opportunities, as their proactive approach and passion for game design will undoubtedly contribute to any project they undertake.
