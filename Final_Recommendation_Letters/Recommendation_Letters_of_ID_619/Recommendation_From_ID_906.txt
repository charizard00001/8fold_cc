I am pleased to recommend an exceptional individual for their remarkable contributions as a Game Design Intern. As an HR Executive with a strong background in human resources management and people-oriented practices, I have had the opportunity to observe this individual’s development in various roles, particularly in their current position. The ability to oversee documentation and organize files is complemented by their creativity as a Level Designer, where they’ve demonstrated talent in conceptualizing engaging game mechanics.

Their experience in fast-paced environments and team leadership—gained through roles in concessions management—has fostered invaluable skills that translate effectively into collaborative game design. As a mentor to junior team members, they not only fulfill their responsibilities with diligence but also uplift those around them. Their commitment to excellence and strong work ethic shines through in all that they do, making them an asset in any setting, especially within creative and technical fields.
