Having had the privilege of working alongside a remarkable Mechanical Design Engineer Intern with a strong foundation in product design and analysis, I wholeheartedly recommend their capabilities. As an Information Technology Consultant with extensive experience in technical troubleshooting and network management, I recognize the value this individual brings to any engineering team. Their hands-on experience in Finite Element Analysis, 3D modeling, and stress analysis, combined with their proficiency in using software like SolidWorks and Ansys, demonstrates not only their technical skills but also their ability to innovate and improve design processes.

During their internship, they showcased an exceptional ability to enhance existing designs and deliver projects under tight deadlines. I was particularly impressed by their success in standardizing templates to streamline calculations, which reflects a deep understanding of both engineering principles and practical efficiency. Their dedication and problem-solving skills make them a valuable asset in any engineering or technical environment. I am confident they will excel in their future endeavors.
