As an experienced Operations Manager with over 12 years at the Port of Los Angeles, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role that a Recreation and Sports Coordinator plays in ensuring efficient operations and exceptional service delivery. The dedication and leadership demonstrated in managing recreation leagues and supervising programs highlight a deep commitment to fostering a productive and engaging environment for both staff and participants. 

This individual's qualifications, including ACSM Exercise Physiologist certification, reflect a strong commitment to health and safety, which is paramount in any recreational facility. Their ability to develop innovative programs while effectively managing finances aligns perfectly with the demands of both our industries, emphasizing a common goal of operational excellence and client satisfaction. 

I wholeheartedly recommend this candidate for a Recreation Supervisor position, as their skills and experiences will undoubtedly contribute positively to any organization. Their proactive approach and collaborative nature are qualities that will lead to measurable improvements and a thriving work culture.
