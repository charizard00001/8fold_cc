As a former Aviation Electronics Technician, I have witnessed firsthand the impressive skills and dedication exhibited by the Outside Machinist. His extensive military experience and training provide him with a solid foundation in technical capabilities, particularly in carrier overhaul planning and scheduling. During my tenure in military leadership positions, I saw him excel as a Work Center Control Representative, where he effectively coordinated between numerous stakeholders, ensuring timely completion of complex projects and maintaining high standards of safety and compliance.

His expertise in installation and maintenance of critical machinery is matched by his excellent administrative capabilities, which he honed while supervising teams and managing intricate work candidates. I wholeheartedly endorse his candidacy, as he brings a combination of practical skills and leadership experiences that would greatly benefit any organization. His commitment to excellence and proven track record of successful project execution are assets that any team would be fortunate to have.
