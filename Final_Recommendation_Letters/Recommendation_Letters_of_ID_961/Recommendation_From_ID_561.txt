As a dedicated school counselor with years of experience fostering healthy learning environments, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with a remarkable dance educator and clinical mental health counselor. In her role, she has successfully planned and implemented dance curricula for diverse students while also providing critical mental health support through dance/movement therapy. Her approach not only enhances creativity and physical movement but also addresses the emotional needs of her students, making her an invaluable resource within our educational community.

Her ability to connect with students and establish rapport reflects her deep understanding of various counseling methods. I have witnessed her work firsthand in integrating expressive arts into therapy, which has significantly improved students' communication skills and self-esteem. Her compassion, empathy, and proactive nature contribute to creating a supportive atmosphere for students facing behavioral challenges, ensuring everyone feels valued and heard. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any opportunity in education or mental health fields.
