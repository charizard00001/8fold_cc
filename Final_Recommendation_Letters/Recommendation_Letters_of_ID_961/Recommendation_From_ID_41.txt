As a co-founder and therapist specializing in art and play therapies, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a dedicated dance educator and dance/movement therapist. This individual is not only proactive but also excels at building rapport with a diverse clientele, making them an invaluable partner in the mental health field. 

With an extensive background in clinical mental health counseling and expressive therapies, this professional enhances therapeutic experiences through innovative dance and movement techniques. Their ability to implement a comprehensive healing arts program demonstrates a deep commitment to improving clients' emotional and physical well-being. 

Throughout our time working together, I have observed their exceptional skills in facilitating both individual and group therapy sessions, expertly managing a wide range of client needs, from developmental disabilities to mental health challenges. Their collaborative spirit and creative approach have made a significant impact on the therapeutic outcomes of our joint projects, and I wholeheartedly support their ongoing endeavors.
