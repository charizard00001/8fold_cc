Having worked closely with the Clinical Mental Health Counselor and Dance/Movement Therapist, I can wholeheartedly recommend them for any position requiring a compassionate and skilled professional in therapeutic practices. As an Expressive Arts Program Leader, I have seen firsthand the impact that creative therapies can have on individuals facing challenges, particularly adolescents in vulnerable populations. 

The dedication demonstrated in planning and implementing therapeutic dance and movement programs has been inspiring. Their ability to engage a diverse range of clients, including those with developmental disabilities, speaks volumes about their versatility and expertise in adapting techniques to meet unique needs. Their extensive experience and mastery in combining expressive arts with evidence-based therapeutic approaches—including CBT and DBT—ensure a well-rounded treatment experience. 

The collaborative spirit and rapport-building skills exhibited make them an invaluable asset to any program focused on enhancing social, emotional, and coping skills through innovative artistic mediums.
