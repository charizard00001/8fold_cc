The skills and expertise exhibited in the resume of the aspiring intern reveal a deep understanding of statistical analysis and data management, particularly with SAS and R programming. With a Master's in Statistics and hands-on experience in predictive modeling and data visualization, this individual would be an asset to any organization seeking data-driven decision-making. 

In contrast, the Chief Operating Officer has a rich history of leadership within medical and banking sectors, managing complex operations and driving significant revenue growth. Having successfully negotiated critical contracts, overseen multi-million dollar projects, and enhanced team performance through effective communication and strategic planning, their proficiency in transforming challenges into opportunities is commendable. 

The intern's quantitative skills would greatly enrich the strategic endeavors of a leader like the COO, enhancing their ongoing efforts in data analysis and operation efficiency. Given these complementary strengths, I wholeheartedly recommend the intern as a valuable addition to any professional team.
