As a former Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Boberg at the College of Business Administration and Economics, I had the opportunity to develop strong analytical and managerial skills that I have carried into my professional career. My experience in market research and creating business plans has provided me with a solid foundation in strategic management and financial analysis. 

I wholeheartedly recommend the Chief Operating Officer, whose outstanding leadership in a medical practice showcases exceptional strategic planning and operational efficiency. This professional successfully expanded clinic operations while dramatically increasing revenues and negotiating significant cost savings. The ability to foster collaboration among diverse teams and manage complex projects reflects remarkable communication and organizational skills. Their strategic insights and financial acumen, demonstrated through cost-saving negotiations and effective project oversight, make them an invaluable asset in any organization. Their impressive leadership is an inspiration, and I am confident in their capacity to drive success in future endeavors.
