As a Client Relations Advocate with extensive experience in customer service and administrative support, I have had the privilege of working alongside a dedicated professional in the dental field. The individual pursuing a career as a Dental Assistant not only exhibits a remarkable work ethic but also possesses an exceptional ability to connect with patients and colleagues alike. In their previous roles as a Registered Dental Assistant, they have demonstrated proficiency in a variety of dental procedures, including chairside assistance and instrument sterilization, while maintaining a commitment to patient care and safety.

This individual's strong attention to detail, exceptional organization, and ability to thrive in high-pressure environments greatly align with the values that I uphold in my own work. They consistently show the ability to effectively manage schedules and ensure a smooth operation within the practice. Their passion for dental assisting and commitment to ongoing education truly set them apart as an invaluable asset to any dental team. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any opportunity in the dental field.
