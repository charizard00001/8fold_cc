Having worked as a Lead Administrator, I have had the privilege of observing exceptional professionals in action, and I can wholeheartedly recommend my colleague, who has proven to be an invaluable asset in her role as a Dental Assistant. Throughout her career, she has exemplified the qualities of a dedicated team player, seamlessly managing patient interactions with warmth and professionalism while maintaining rigorous adherence to infection control protocols. Her ability to prepare patients for dental procedures and ensure their comfort is noteworthy, illustrating her commitment to patient-centered care.

Her proficiency in dental assisting tasks, from sterilizing instruments to assisting with a variety of complex procedures, highlights her comprehensive skill set. I have no doubt that her strong organizational skills and clear communication style, honed through her experience, will greatly benefit any dental practice. I highly recommend her for an experienced-level position as she continues to pursue her career in dentistry.
