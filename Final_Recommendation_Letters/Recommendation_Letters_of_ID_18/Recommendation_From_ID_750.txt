I am pleased to recommend a diligent and capable individual with whom I had the pleasure of working during their internship in Support & Network Services. As an IT Manager, I have witnessed firsthand the value that a dedicated intern brings to a tech-driven environment, and this individual exemplifies that spirit. They demonstrated impressive technical skills, particularly in the installation and configuration of both Windows and Linux operating systems, showing adaptability in a dynamic workplace.

During their internship, they efficiently customized and implemented Microsoft SCSM, facilitating asset management and user onboarding processes. Their eagerness to learn, along with their solid understanding of networking and support services, significantly benefited our team. They also exhibited excellent communication skills while collaborating with peers, effectively documenting processes, and contributing to daily operations. I have no doubt that this individual will continue to excel in the IT field and be a valuable asset to any organization.
