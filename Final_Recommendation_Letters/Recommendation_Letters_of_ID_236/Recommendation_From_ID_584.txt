During my time as a Database Programmer/Analyst, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a remarkable educator known for their innovative teaching methods and dedication to student success. With 13 years of experience, they have implemented a variety of instructional strategies, ensuring individual learning needs are met while fostering an engaging classroom environment. Their recognition as a "highly effective" teacher and a High Impact Teacher by the Florida Department of Education speaks volumes about their commitment to educational excellence.

In our interactions, I witnessed their ability to analyze data trends effortlessly, optimally utilizing technology such as Google Classroom and various assessment tools. This proficiency is akin to the agile methodologies I employed in developing software solutions, where data analysis was crucial for project success. Their mentorship role further highlights their leadership qualities, making them not only an asset in the classroom but also a valuable contributor to the wider educational community. I highly recommend them for any position that values expertise in teaching and collaborative skills.
