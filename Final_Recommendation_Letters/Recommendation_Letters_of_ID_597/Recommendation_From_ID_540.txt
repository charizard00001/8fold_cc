As a Youth Advocate with years of experience in education and mental health, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with a remarkable School Success Advocate who excels in fostering academic and social growth among students. This individual leads an extended day program, providing invaluable academic support to high school freshmen while simultaneously enhancing their social skills in a supportive learning environment. Their leadership and bilingual communication skills truly bridge gaps between students, families, and educators, creating a community of engagement and support.

This School Success Advocate has also effectively implemented mentorship programs that empower students, particularly within the Latino community, showcasing their commitment to advocacy and social justice. Their ability to establish solid relationships with families is commendable, ensuring that students have the resources they need to succeed. I wholeheartedly recommend this advocate, as their dedication and innovative practices will undoubtedly contribute positively to any educational setting.
