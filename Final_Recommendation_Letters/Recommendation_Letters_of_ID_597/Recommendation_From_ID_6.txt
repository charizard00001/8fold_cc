As an Organizer and Capacity Building Strategist, I have had the pleasure of working alongside a dedicated School Success Advocate who possesses an impressive track record in fostering academic achievement and personal growth among high school students. In their current role, they facilitate an extended day program that not only equips students with essential academic support but also cultivates vital social skills in a nurturing environment. Their bilingual communication with families exemplifies their commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.

With a background in coordinating mentorship programs specifically for Latino students, this advocate creates pathways for academic success, aligning perfectly with my own advocacy efforts for individuals with disabilities. Their experience in program development and family engagement has demonstrated positive outcomes in recruitment, retention, and overall student performance. Given their unwavering dedication to student empowerment and community involvement, I wholeheartedly recommend this advocate for any educational initiative focused on fostering student success and community engagement.
