I highly recommend the front desk attendant for any position in the aviation field, drawing from my background as a maintenance mechanic in the same sector. With a Bachelor’s degree in Aviation Management and now pursuing further studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, the front desk attendant demonstrates a strong commitment to aviation and business systems. Their experience in managing operations at an FBO and coordinating aircraft activities showcases their ability to handle critical tasks in a fast-paced environment. 

During my time working in mechanical maintenance, I witnessed how essential collaboration and communication are in aviation. The front desk attendant excels in these areas with excellent English skills and bilingual capabilities in Portuguese, making them an asset in diverse settings. They have proven problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, all of which would greatly benefit any aviation organization seeking to enhance its operational efficiency and service quality.
