In my capacity as a Finance Manager with over 15 years of experience in the automotive and F&I departments, I have had the pleasure of working alongside a remarkable Special Finance Manager. This individual has adeptly managed all aspects of special finance operations, demonstrating exceptional skills in strategic planning and risk analysis, which led to a notable increase in sales by 57% shortly after assuming the role. Their innovative management techniques not only streamlined operations but also propelled the dealership to achieve premier sales status in the North East Texas Region.

With a focus on profitability and customer satisfaction, this Special Finance Manager consistently drives results and has proven to be an invaluable asset in any financial capacity. I wholeheartedly recommend this professional for any future endeavors in finance management.
