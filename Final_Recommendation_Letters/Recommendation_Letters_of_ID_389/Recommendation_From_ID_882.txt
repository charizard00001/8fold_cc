I am pleased to recommend an exceptional finance executive whose contributions to corporate finance are truly noteworthy. As the Vice President of Corporate Finance, this individual has demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate complex financial landscapes, managing a wide variety of consolidated corporate departments within the healthcare sector. This role requires expertise in risk management, contract negotiations, and technical U.S. GAAP accounting, all areas where they excel.

In particular, I have witnessed their skill in leading multi-disciplinary teams to achieve mission-critical objectives, such as overseeing significant tax exempt bond financings that have saved the organization millions. Their ability to maintain strong relationships with external vendors and boards speaks volumes about their communication skills and professionalism.

While I’ve focused my career on retail and customer finance, I recognize the parallels in our objectives—maximizing financial efficiency and fostering effective teamwork. I wholeheartedly endorse this finance leader for any future endeavors, confident in their ability to make a substantial impact.
