I am pleased to recommend a dedicated food server with whom I have had the pleasure of working. With over sixteen years in the customer service industry, this individual has consistently demonstrated exceptional skill in communication, customer relations, and multi-tasking. During my tenure as a Theater Arts Teacher and Program Director, where effective collaboration and the ability to connect with diverse groups were key, I noticed how well this person engaged with customers and handled challenges. 

Their experience as a crew trainer and their knack for resolving guest complaints exemplify their leadership qualities and commitment to service excellence. This individual brings a proactive and friendly demeanor to every interaction, making them a great asset in any environment. I am confident that their strong work ethic and ability to foster positive relationships will greatly benefit any organization they join, much like my own experience in fostering student engagement in education and the arts.
