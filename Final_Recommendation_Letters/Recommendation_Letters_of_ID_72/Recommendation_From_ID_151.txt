Having worked together at Michael's Arts and Crafts Store, where I was involved in various managerial roles, I have had the pleasure of witnessing the dedication and diligence of a very capable individual. During her time as a food server, she consistently demonstrated exceptional customer service skills, which were further highlighted in her role as a Crew Trainer. Her ability to handle POS systems and train new staff was instrumental in streamlining operations and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Her remarkable interpersonal skills, paired with her extensive experience in the food service industry, reflect a commitment to excellence that resonates with the values of any customer-centric organization. I have no doubt that her proactive approach and reliability will be tremendous assets in any future endeavors. If you are considering her for a position, I wholeheartedly recommend her, knowing she will exceed expectations and foster positive relationships with customers and colleagues alike.
