With over twenty-four years of military service and extensive training experience, I have had the privilege of working closely with a remarkable food server who excels in customer service and teamwork. This individual has sixteen years of invaluable experience in the restaurant industry, demonstrating exceptional skills in both high-pressure environments and routine operations. Their commitment to excellent customer service is evident through various accomplishments, including serving as a crew trainer, where they played a crucial role in mentoring new staff.

Their ability to foster positive relationships with both customers and coworkers is commendable and aligns perfectly with the values instilled during my military career. Both of us understand the importance of effective communication, multitasking, and maintaining a high standard of operations. This food server's professionalism, reliability, and approach to problem-solving make them an valuable asset to any team, and I wholeheartedly recommend their candidacy for future opportunities.
