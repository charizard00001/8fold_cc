As a Hiring Manager with extensive experience in healthcare recruitment, I have had the pleasure of observing the growth and dedication of a talented individual in healthcare administration during their internship. While completing their internship, a well-organized and diligent healthcare administration intern demonstrated a proactive approach by conducting feasibility studies and effectively managing schedules for a team of 16 employees. This intern displayed strong analytical skills, contributing to departmental goals and enhancing communication protocols among staff.

Their ability to work alongside various departments, coupled with instinctive problem-solving capabilities, uniquely positions them for future roles in healthcare. I am confident that their background in health administration, combined with their practical experience and commitment to quality improvement, will lead them to success in any administrative capacity. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual as they continue to advance their career in healthcare administration.
