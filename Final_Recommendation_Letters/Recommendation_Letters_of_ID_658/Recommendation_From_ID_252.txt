I am pleased to recommend a remarkable healthcare administration intern who has shown exceptional potential in the field. Working under my supervision as an Electronic Health Record Optimization Specialist, I observed their ability to communicate effectively and lead strategic planning initiatives. During their internship, they conducted feasibility studies and implemented new scheduling guidelines, demonstrating a keen analytical mindset.

Their experience in the healthcare sector, particularly through roles in pulmonary labs and patient education, complements my focus on improving quality measures and clinical outcomes within primary care settings. The intern's diligent efforts in organizing departmental goals and staff training initiatives position them as a valuable asset to any healthcare team. With a strong foundation in quality improvement and a proactive approach, they have the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare administration. I am confident that their skills and dedication will greatly benefit any organization fortunate enough to have them.
