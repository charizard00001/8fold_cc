Having worked closely with a highly experienced Finance Officer, I can confidently recommend this individual for any finance-related position. With over 25 years of experience in accounting, government auditing, and budget management, they excelled as a Finance Officer and Acting Bureau of Internal Revenue Representative at the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco. Their outstanding ability to manage finances was exemplified by increasing BIR income tax collections by an impressive 500%. Their meticulous attention to detail and organizational skills have significantly contributed to effective financial reporting and analysis.

On the other hand, the HR Assistant has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in human resources over the past three years. Their ability to juggle multiple tasks efficiently and foster communication across departments has proven invaluable in the recruitment and onboarding processes. Given the Finance Officer's wealth of knowledge and experience in finance and budget management, coupled with the HR Assistant's strong communication and analytical skills, I have no doubt that they would work harmoniously in any organizational setting to achieve exceptional results.
