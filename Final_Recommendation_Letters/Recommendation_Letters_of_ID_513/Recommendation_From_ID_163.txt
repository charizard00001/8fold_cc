Having worked as a Certified Custom Framer for several years, I've honed my customer service skills and developed a keen eye for detail while assisting clients in selecting customized framing options. I have also taken on training responsibilities for new associates and ensured high-quality service under tight deadlines. In my experience, I have come to appreciate the importance of strong organizational abilities and effective communication within a team setting.

My recommendation for an Independent Consultant stems from my recognition of that individual's remarkable skills in customer service and event planning. Their ability to engage clients and provide exceptional service mirrors my own dedication to customer satisfaction. The successful orchestration of events for numerous congregations demonstrates their strong multitasking and leadership capabilities, making them a valuable asset in any professional setting. Their proactive approach and creative problem-solving skills were instrumental in driving business growth, akin to the dedication I strive for in my own work.
