I am pleased to recommend a colleague who consistently demonstrates exceptional skills and dedication in the retail environment. As a Certified Custom Framer, I have worked closely with an individual at Michael's Arts and Crafts Store, where they hold multiple management roles, including Assistant Store Manager and Full-Time Replenishment Manager. Their commitment to delivering outstanding customer service aligns with my own standards, as both of us strive to create an inviting atmosphere for customers.

This individual possesses remarkable leadership abilities, training new associates with clarity and purpose. Their background in environmental technology and management brings a unique perspective to the store, ensuring operational efficiency while also advocating sustainable practices. They have successfully assumed various responsibilities, showcasing adaptability and a strong work ethic. I have no doubt that their determination and problem-solving skills will continue to benefit any team fortunate enough to have them. I wholeheartedly endorse their pursuit of excellence in any future endeavors.
