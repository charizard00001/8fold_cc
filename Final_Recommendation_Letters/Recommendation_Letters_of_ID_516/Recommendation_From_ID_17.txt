Having worked extensively in finance, I highly recommend the individual currently serving as Assistant Director of Finance. With a solid foundation in accounting and a wealth of experience, this professional has excelled in various roles, such as Planning and Analysis Manager and Senior Analyst, proving their adeptness in budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. Their ability to streamline processes while working closely with hotel General Managers demonstrates exceptional organizational and analytical skills.

In my own role as Finance Manager, I have focused on developing program budgets, contract negotiations, and auditing practices across diverse sectors. The Assistant Director's experience in managing relationships for multiple hotel operations aligns well with my background in government contracting and cost accounting. Their contributions to financial systems and operational reviews illustrate a commitment to excellence that would enrich any organization. Overall, the breadth of their expertise and leadership capabilities set them apart as a valuable asset in any financial environment.
