The Retail Sales Consultant at Express Scripts has demonstrated exceptional skills in customer service and supervision and has an impressive track record of fulfilling leadership roles. Their agility in handling customer interactions and issuing credits showcases an innate adaptability that transcends retail into the realm of healthcare. As someone who has witnessed their work firsthand, I confidently endorse their exceptional capabilities, which would be invaluable in a demanding phlebotomy role. 

Meanwhile, the Phlebotomist Preceptor boasts a remarkable ability to maintain compliance with intricate healthcare regulations while managing significant pressures. However, this candidate also showcased weaknesses in essential sales techniques during our collaborative efforts in a joint marketing initiative, suggesting a perfect opportunity for growth away from the clinical side. With their unique blend of analytical skills and familiarity in lab environments, they may find a surprising aptitude for managing retail sales dynamics.
