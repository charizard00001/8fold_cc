As a Human Resource Personnel Assistant, my experience in HR has given me a solid foundation in administrative support and personnel management. During my tenure, I witnessed firsthand the impressive skills that a colleague demonstrated when performing as a Human Resource/Finance Analyst. With a strong background in precise data management and excellent customer service, this professional successfully resolved complex HR and payroll issues for Columbia University, showcasing a keen understanding of HR policies and labor laws. Their proficiency in systems such as PeopleSoft HCM greatly enhanced operational efficiency. Moreover, their ability to supervise large teams and conduct orientation training reflects strong leadership skills that contribute positively to organizational success. As someone who has interacted closely with them in various capacities, I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any future HR-related opportunities. Their expertise and dedication will undoubtedly be a tremendous asset to any team.
