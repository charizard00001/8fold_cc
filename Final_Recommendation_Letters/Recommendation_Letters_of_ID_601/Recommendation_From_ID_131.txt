As a Senior HR Manager with extensive experience in managing human resources for a complex healthcare organization, I had the pleasure of working alongside Rachael Lobdell, a Senior Outreach Advocate dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable populations. Rachael's compassion and commitment to client welfare were evident in her daily interactions, where she utilized her exceptional communication skills to educate clients about service options and navigate them through the complexities of healthcare applications and benefits.

Rachael brought a unique blend of leadership and empathy to every situation, effectively managing her schedule while also ensuring her team's needs were met, promoting integration and continuity of care. Her ability to analyze patient needs and deliver tailored solutions aligns perfectly with the organizational optimization strategies I have implemented throughout my career. I wholeheartedly recommend Rachael for any role where her advocacy, creativity, and dedication to improving healthcare services will shine brightly. She possesses outstanding qualities that would be an asset to any organization.
