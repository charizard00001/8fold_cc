I am pleased to recommend a highly skilled nursing professional who has consistently demonstrated strong leadership and management abilities throughout her extensive career in healthcare. As a General Accountant at Comply365, I had the opportunity to work closely with this remarkable individual during our time at the company. While I handled financial operations and reports, she managed nursing staff and day-to-day healthcare for children and adults with complex needs as an Assistant Director of Nursing. Her exceptional organizational skills and dedication to mentorship were evident as she consistently developed her team while ensuring high standards of patient care.

Her experience in both managing critical nursing operations and caring for patients speaks volumes about her commitment, resilience, and ability to thrive in high-pressure situations. I am confident she will be an asset in any role she pursues and can adapt her extensive knowledge in nursing management, making her an invaluable member of any healthcare team.
