As the Center Director and Head Start Family Advocate, I confidently recommend the Organizer and Capacity Building Strategist for any role in advocacy or community organization. Through years of collaboration with families and supporting their growth, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent need for strategic advocacy, which aligns perfectly with the skill set demonstrated by this individual. The expertise in case management and crisis intervention I have honed mirrors the strategist's extensive background in providing support and training to families, particularly in navigating disability and special education rights. 

Exceptional interpersonal communication and relationship-building have been my focus, much like the impactful community organizing and training initiatives that this strategist developed for over 300 parents annually. The ability to think critically and strategize outcomes for clients is evident in their experience, making them an invaluable asset to any team striving for social justice and equitable resource access.
