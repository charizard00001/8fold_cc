The work ethic and dedication displayed in both professional experiences are commendable. As an Administrative Office Assistant and an Adjunct Faculty member, there is exceptional expertise in managing diverse tasks, such as customer service and lesson planning for undergraduate health courses. This experience enhances the ability to engage effectively with students, fostering critical thinking and real-world applications in their education.

In contrast, the role of a Floater/Teacher demonstrates an impressive adaptability and compassion for children ranging from 6 weeks to Pre-K. With a unique approach to classroom management and an ability to create engaging yet educational environments, this individual successfully implemented the first Health Curriculum at the Jewish Academy, showcasing innovation in health education.

Both individuals bring valuable skills in health, fitness, and education, making the collaboration between them a powerful opportunity for promoting wellness and effective teaching methodologies in their respective environments. I wholeheartedly endorse this partnership.
