Having served as the Director of Information Technology for a prominent commercial real estate investment firm, I had the opportunity to closely observe the remarkable skills and dedication of the HR Assistant Intern during her brief tenure in our organization. In her role, she provided vital administrative support to the Human Resources Director, showcasing her attention to detail and strong organizational abilities while handling I-9 verifications and managing employee documentation efficiently.

Her exceptional communication skills and sound judgment were evident as she navigated various tasks, displaying a level of professionalism beyond her years. Despite her limited experience, she demonstrated a keen ability to resolve conflicts and foster positive relationships within the team. This combination of interpersonal skills and a strong work ethic positions her as an asset to any organization. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any future endeavors in human resources or counseling, as she is bound to excel in any capacity she pursues.
