I am pleased to recommend a highly capable Corporate Controller who possesses an impressive history of success in managing complex accounting functions. With a background in overseeing a 30-person accounting team, this individual has demonstrated exceptional leadership and adaptability within diverse sectors, including banking and finance, following extensive mergers and acquisitions. 

In my role as a Senior Lending Officer at a regional Community Bank, I have had the pleasure of witnessing firsthand the strategic insights and operational excellence this Controller brings to the table. Their finance leadership in multi-million dollar initiatives, particularly in streamlining processes during rapid company growth, has been remarkable. I personally value their collaboration as the primary contact with banking relationships, ensuring the successful implementation of critical financial systems. 

In summary, this Corporate Controller is a results-driven leader whose extensive expertise would be an incredible asset to any organization in need of financial oversight and strategic direction.
