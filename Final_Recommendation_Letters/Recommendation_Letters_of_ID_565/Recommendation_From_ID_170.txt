Having worked in the customer service industry for over 25 years, I have had the privilege of watching a talented individual exemplify what it means to deliver outstanding service. The Retail Sales Consultant at Express Scripts exhibits remarkable problem-solving and communication skills, enabling her to effectively manage customer inquiries and resolve issues swiftly. She has consistently met and exceeded sales goals, showcasing her ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment, much like my own experience as a Senior Member Advocate. 

I have seen her exhibit sound judgment in difficult situations, echoing my commitment to achieving high customer satisfaction. Her leadership qualities are evident as she not only fulfilled supervisory duties but also improved team performance significantly. With her proven track record of excellence, I wholeheartedly recommend her for any position that requires strong organizational capabilities and a dedication to customer service excellence. She would undoubtedly be an invaluable asset to any team.
