I am pleased to recommend a colleague whose exceptional customer service skills and dedication truly stand out. My background as a Receptionist and Veterinary Technician has provided me with a strong foundation in administrative responsibilities and the ability to prioritize tasks effectively. In that role, I frequently interacted with clients, managed appointments, and addressed inquiries, creating a welcoming environment for all.

During my time as a Kids Club Attendant, the qualities of reliability and friendliness flourished. This individual excelled at supervising activities for children and ensured the safety and satisfaction of both kids and their parents. Their experience in customer service and their ability to listen attentively contributed to a positive atmosphere, not unlike the one I strived to cultivate in veterinary care. I stand firmly behind this colleague’s pursuit of a budtender position, confident that they will bring the same level of dedication and professionalism to your team.
