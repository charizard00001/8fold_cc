Having worked as a Charge Nurse for over a decade, my experience in high-stress healthcare environments has taught me the importance of decisive leadership and strategic planning. During this time, I honed my skills in patient care management, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and ensuring safety by implementing effective interventions. I had the pleasure of witnessing an exemplary professional in action, whose project management skills and dedication to cause remarkably complemented my own nursing expertise.

In the role of Senior Advisor and National Fundraising Director, a strong ability to lead diverse teams and manage substantial budgets was evident. The impressive accomplishment of raising $2.25 million in just two months highlighted exceptional organizational skills and strategic insight. This individual’s talent for problem-solving and navigating complex challenges is remarkable and will serve them well, whether in fundraising or within any fast-paced environment. Their people-centered approach inspires confidence and fosters collaboration among team members.
