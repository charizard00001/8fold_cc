I am pleased to recommend a colleague who has demonstrated exceptional skills and expertise in the accounting field. While I serve as an Accountant I with extensive experience in disability services and human resources within the finance department, my colleague has excelled in a comprehensive accounting role focused on experimental therapeutics research, where they create financial reports for principal investigators (PIs) and assist in preparing operating budgets. 

This individual is adept at financial modeling, reconciliation, and maintaining compliance with financial controls. Their work significantly enhances departmental efficiency, evidenced by their implementation of a macro-enabled reconciliation template that improved accuracy by reducing keying errors. With their strong analytical skills, fearlessness in tackling complex financial data, and dedication to improving operational workflows, they would be an invaluable asset to any organization. I wholeheartedly endorse their capability and professionalism in the accounting discipline.
