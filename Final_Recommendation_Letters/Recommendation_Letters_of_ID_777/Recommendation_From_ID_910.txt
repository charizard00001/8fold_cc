I am pleased to recommend an exceptional talent who has shown remarkable promise as a production assistant intern. With a background in media management and production, this individual has already gained invaluable experience assisting casting directors, producers, and actors. They demonstrated impressive organizational skills while managing schedules and handling production equipment, showcasing their ability to thrive in high-pressure environments. 

As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I have seen my share of dedicated and passionate individuals, and this intern stands out. Their keen interest in creative development and character writing aligns perfectly with the arts-focused initiatives I have overseen, which have transformed multiple venues into thriving cultural hubs. Moreover, their technical proficiency and strong background in social media will serve them well in any art or production context. I have no doubt that their enthusiasm and skill set will greatly contribute to any team they join in the future.
