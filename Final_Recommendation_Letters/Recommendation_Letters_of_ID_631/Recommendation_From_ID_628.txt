Having collaborated closely with an outstanding HR professional, I wholeheartedly recommend the individual for any HR or Talent Acquisition role. As an HR Intern, my experience recruiting and onboarding for an engineering team at Magnasoft laid the foundation for effective talent acquisition strategies. During my tenure, I successfully filled 122 positions in just six months, an accomplishment that required robust collaboration and innovative sourcing techniques. 

Conversely, the HR Associate expertly developed strategies to enhance university recruitment and managed the internship program, significantly increasing participation in events. Their capacity to build relationships and their proactive approach to problem-solving fostered a highly positive recruitment experience. With experience in various HRIS systems and deep insights into employee relations and training, this professional would be a tremendous asset to any organization. Together, we embody a commitment to cultivating top talent and nurturing organizational growth.
