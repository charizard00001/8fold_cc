Having held the role of Managing Principal in investment banking and management consulting for over a decade, I have had the privilege to collaborate with an exceptional Assistant Vice President. The focus and diligence exhibited in overseeing the complex migration of the Post Trade Confirmation function have been remarkable, particularly in training and managing a large team to achieve compliance with industry regulations such as Dodd-Frank and EMIR. This role required not just technical expertise but also strong leadership and project management skills, which have been expertly demonstrated.

Throughout the years, I have witnessed this individual’s proactive engagement in multi-million-dollar projects that have significantly improved operational efficiencies and mitigated risks. The ability to liaise effectively with diverse teams to ensure seamless execution of high-volume client relationships has been invaluable. I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any position requiring strategic acumen, operational excellence, and a strong commitment to regulatory compliance.
