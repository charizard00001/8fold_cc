Having worked closely with an exceptionally talented individual, I am delighted to recommend someone who embodies creativity and professionalism. As a production assistant intern, experience in various facets of media production has instilled a solid understanding of the industry's demands. This individual effectively assisted casting directors, managed schedules, and contributed to the setup of production equipment. Their proactive attitude and technological finesse have proven invaluable in dynamic environments.

The creative assistant has seamlessly integrated their skills into a high-pressure role, representing the CMI team at external affairs and successfully pitching independent music for placements in prominent VH1 series. Their strong communication skills and ability to multitask have allowed them to build fruitful relationships with music labels and coordinate complex projects with impressive organization.

Both individuals are enthusiastic, dedicated, and possess a genuine passion for the arts, making them well-suited to contribute meaningfully to any creative endeavor.
