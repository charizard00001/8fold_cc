Having spent 14 years in the aviation and aerospace industry, I have had the privilege of witnessing the growth and development of many talented individuals. One such person is a dedicated Aerospace Engineering student actively seeking an internship at Northrop Grumman. Despite being early in their career, this individual has demonstrated exceptional skills and a proactive approach towards aeronautics, particularly in the realm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Their role in constructing advanced UAV models showcases not only their technical proficiency in tools like MATLAB and AVL but also their ability to work collaboratively in team settings.

Furthermore, their experience as an Aviation Camp Assistant illustrates their passion for aviation education and mentorship. The ability to engage younger audiences while sharing insights about aviation solidifies their commitment to the field. With this combination of academic knowledge and practical experience, I wholeheartedly recommend this individual for any opportunities within aerospace engineering, confident that they will contribute significantly to any organization.
