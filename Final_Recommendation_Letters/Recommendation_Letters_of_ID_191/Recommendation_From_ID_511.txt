Having served as a VP of Finance and IS&T, I had the pleasure of working closely with a talented finance manager who consistently demonstrated exceptional skills and dedication to her role. In her capacity as Finance Manager for a charter airline, she adeptly managed a department generating over $4 million in revenues, showcasing her ability to maintain accounts payable, oversee payroll, and ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. Her keen analytical skills enabled her to perform accurate budgetary reviews and forecasts, which were vital for executive oversight.

Moreover, her reputation as a diligent and quick learner allowed her to implement effective controls and policies, ultimately leading to significant cost savings. Her experience in fraud detection and litigation further emphasizes her commitment to integrity in financial reporting. I wholeheartedly recommend her, confident that her professionalism and depth of knowledge will be an invaluable asset in any finance-related endeavor.
